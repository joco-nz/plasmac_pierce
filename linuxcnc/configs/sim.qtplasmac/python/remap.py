# This shows how to create a remapped G-code  which can be used as a cycle
# written in Python
#
# Example:
# Assume G84.2 is remapped to Python g842 like so in the [RS274NGC] ini section:
# REMAP=G84.2 argspec=xyzqp python=g842 modalgroup=1
#    
# then executing
#   
#    G84.2 x1 y1 (line1)
#    x3 y3       (line2)
#    y5          (line3)
#    ...
#
#  will execute like:
#   *G84.2 x1 y1
#    G84.2 x3 y3
#    G84.2 x3 y5
#    
# until motion is cleared with G80 or some other motion is executed.
#   
# This enables writing cycles in Python, or as Oword procedures; in the
# latter case the self.motion_mode should be set in the Python epilog.
#
# for a more through example of a cycle prolog, see cycle_prolog in stdglue.py
